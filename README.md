Meteor Toys
===========

<a href="http://meteor.toys">Meteor Toys</a> are a set of overlay tools designed to help you be more productive and have a good time doing so. By providing a visual interface to some of Meteor's core features, Meteor Toys turn boring activites into fun.

Open Source Version
=============
When you install Meteor Toys, you will recieve: 
 - <a href="http://github.com/msavin/Mongol">Mongol</a>: a visual tool viewing and editing your client-side MongoDB documents
 - <a href="http://github.com/msavin/JetSetter">JetSetter</a>: a visual tool to Get/Set your Session variables

Mongol and JetSetter are a complete alternative to the commands you would run in your console (insert, update, remove, get, set). With a combined 10,000+ installations and 500+ stars on GitHub, you will wonder how you ever got by without them.

Premium Version
===========
The premium Meteor Toys extend your development environment by giving you capabilites that weren't available before. These include:
 - Mongol Pro: featuring trash can for restoring removed documents, and the ability to reset collections
 - JetSetter Pro: featuring the ability to watch reactive variables and dictionaries
 - Impersonate: sign into any account with just a click, as opposed to signing in and out all the time
 - Pub/Sub: View all your active subscriptions instead of guessing if they are on. Click on it to stop it, or to start a new one. 
 - Shell: Run code as a method on your server and get the results back in the console. Great for testing methods as you write them.
 - Method: View a list of all your application methods, then click on them to enter their params and call them. The result goes to your console.
 - DDP Listener: With just a click to start, you can observe how data flows in and out your application.
 - Hot Reload: Trigger a hot reload with just a click. So much easier than trying to trigger it than by modifying your code. 

Plug-&-Play Installation
========================
Simply install the package, then press Control + M in the browser window to activate.
