Meteor Toys
===========

Meteor Toys are a set of overlay tools designed to help you more productive and to help you enjoy more. By providing a visual interface to some of Meteor's core features, Meteor Toys turn the boring stuff into fun.

Basic Version
=============
Upon installation, you will receive Mongol and JetSetter in your applications. Mongol allows you to visually fetch, insert remove and update your MongoDB colections. JetSetter allows you get/set values for Session variables. Mongol and JetSetter are becoming standard tools in the Meteor community, with a combined 10,000+ organic downloads and 500+ stars on GitHub.

Pro Version
===========
By purchasing a Meteor Toys license, you can unlock the next level of these tools while supporting their development. Imagine the ease of working with:
 - Mongol Pro: featuring trash can for restoring removed documents, and the ability to reset collections
 - JetSetter Pro: featuring ability to watch reactive variables and dictionaries, and 
 - Impersonate: Tired of signing in and out of accounts to test your app? With Impersonate, you can log in as any account with one click.
 - Pub/Sub: View all your active subscriptions instead of guessing if they are on. Click on it to stop it, or to start a new one. 
 - Shell: Run code as a method on your server and get the results in the console. Great for testing methods while you write them.
 - Method: View a list of all your application methods, then click on them to enter their params and call them. No more running through the source to see how it works. 
 - DDP Listener: With just a click to start, you can observe how data flows in and out your application.
 - Reloader: Trigger a hot reload with just a click. So much easier than trying to stick a space somewhere in your app to trigger it.

Plug-&-Play Installation
========================
Simply install the package, then press Control + M in the browser window to activate. No configuration necessary.
